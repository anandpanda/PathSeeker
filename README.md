## Overview
PathSeeker is a web-based application designed to help users find the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm. The application features an interactive user interface where users can click to choose the source and destination nodes from a map, visualize the algorithm's step-by-step execution.

## Features
- **Interactive Map:** Users can click to select the source and destination nodes from a map interface.
- **Algorithm Visualization:** The application provides a visual representation of Dijkstra's algorithm as it computes the shortest path.

## Technologies
- **HTML:** Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout of the application.
- **JavaScript:** Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, interactive map features.

## Installation
To run PathSeeker locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anandpanda/pathseeker.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd pathseeker
    ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Usage
1. **Open the application in your web browser.**
2. **Select source and destination nodes:**
   - Click on the map to choose the source node.
   - Click on another location to set it as the destination node.
3. **Observe the path and distance:**
   - As soon as you click on the destination node, you can view the animated path and corresponding shortest distance.
